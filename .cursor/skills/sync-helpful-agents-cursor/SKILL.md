# Sync Helpful Agents Cursor Configs

Mirrors workspace `.cursor/skills/` and `.cursor/commands/` to `Helpful Agents/.cursor/skills/` and `Helpful Agents/.cursor/commands/` for public sharing on GitHub.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:

- User wants to sync cursor configs to Helpful Agents
- User mentions "mirror skills", "sync commands", "update Helpful Agents"
- User says "sync cursor configs" or "mirror .cursor folder"
- Before pushing Helpful Agents to GitHub (to ensure latest configs)
- After creating/modifying skills or commands (to publish changes)

## Context

**Purpose:** Keep public Helpful Agents repo synchronized with actual cursor configurations

**Direction:** One-way sync: Workspace `.cursor/` → `Helpful Agents/.cursor/`

**What gets synced:**

- All files in `.cursor/skills/` (skills, references, scripts, assets)
- All files in `.cursor/commands/` (command markdown files)

**What gets excluded:**

- `.DS_Store` files (macOS metadata)
- Temporary files

## Execution Flow

### Phase 1: Pre-Flight Checks

**Verify workspace structure:**

1. Check workspace root exists:

   ```bash
   pwd  # Should be workspace root (Personal Builder Lab or Project Understanding)
   ```
2. Verify source directories exist:

   ```bash
   ls -d .cursor/skills 2>/dev/null && echo "✅ Skills found" || echo "⚠️ No skills"
   ls -d .cursor/commands 2>/dev/null && echo "✅ Commands found" || echo "⚠️ No commands"
   ```
3. Verify Helpful Agents exists and is a git repo:

   ```bash
   ls -d "Helpful Agents/.git" 2>/dev/null && echo "✅ Helpful Agents repo found" || echo "❌ Not a git repo"
   ```

**If any check fails:**

- Report to user which component is missing
- Provide guidance on resolving the issue
- Do not proceed with sync

### Phase 2: Sync Skills

**Command:**

```bash
rsync -av --delete --exclude='.DS_Store' \
  ".cursor/skills/" \
  "Helpful Agents/.cursor/skills/"
```

**Flags explained:**

- `-a`: Archive mode (preserves permissions, timestamps, subdirectories)
- `-v`: Verbose (shows what's being transferred)
- `--delete`: Remove files in destination that don't exist in source (true mirror)
- `--exclude='.DS_Store'`: Skip macOS metadata files

**What this does:**

- Copies all skill folders and their contents
- Mirrors directory structure exactly
- Removes any skills in Helpful Agents that were deleted from workspace
- Preserves all subdirectories (references/, scripts/, assets/)

### Phase 3: Sync Commands

**Command:**

```bash
rsync -av --delete --exclude='.DS_Store' \
  ".cursor/commands/" \
  "Helpful Agents/.cursor/commands/"
```

**What this does:**

- Copies all command markdown files
- Removes any commands in Helpful Agents that were deleted from workspace
- Ensures exact mirror of commands

### Phase 4: Verify Sync

**Check what changed:**

```bash
cd "Helpful Agents"
git status --short
```

**Interpret results:**

- `A` (added): New files synced
- `M` (modified): Existing files updated
- `D` (deleted): Files removed from Helpful Agents (cleaned up)
- No output: Already in sync (no changes)

### Phase 5: Report Summary

**Generate report:**

Count changes by type:

- New files added
- Files modified
- Files deleted
- Total files synced

**Report format:**

```
✅ Cursor configs synced to Helpful Agents

Skills synced: X files
Commands synced: Y files

Changes detected:
  • Added: A files
  • Modified: M files  
  • Deleted: D files

Status: Ready for git commit in Helpful Agents/
Next: Run @git-sync to push changes to GitHub
```

### Error: Missing Directory

```
❌ Sync failed: Source directory not found

Missing: .cursor/skills/
Location: <workspace-root>

Solutions:
1. Verify you're in the correct workspace
2. Check if .cursor/skills exists: ls -la .cursor/
3. Create skills directory if needed: mkdir -p .cursor/skills
```

### Error: Helpful Agents Not Found

```
❌ Sync failed: Helpful Agents repo not found

Expected: Helpful Agents/.git
Location: <workspace-root>

Solutions:
1. Verify Helpful Agents folder exists: ls -d "Helpful Agents"
2. Check if it's a git repo: ls "Helpful Agents/.git"
3. Clone if missing: See workspace CLAUDE.md for setup
```

## Critical Rules

### Sync Direction

| Source                  | Destination                               | Direction  |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| ✅`.cursor/skills/`   | `Helpful Agents/.cursor/skills/`        | One-way → |
| ✅`.cursor/commands/` | `Helpful Agents/.cursor/commands/`      | One-way → |
| ❌ NEVER reverse        | Workspace `.cursor/` is source of truth | Never ←   |

**Why one-way:**

- Workspace `.cursor/` is the working copy (where you create/edit)
- Helpful Agents is the publication copy (for GitHub sharing)
- Prevents accidental overwrites of working configs

### After Sync

**Always review changes before pushing:**

1. **Check git status:**

   ```bash
   cd "Helpful Agents" && git status
   ```
2. **Review diffs:**

   ```bash
   cd "Helpful Agents" && git diff
   ```
3. **Commit and push** (if changes look correct):

   ```bash
   @git-sync Helpful_Agents
   ```

### What Gets Synced

| Item                 | Synced? | Reason                    |
| -------------------- | ------- | ------------------------- |
| ✅ Skills (SKILL.md) | Yes     | Core skill definitions    |
| ✅ References/       | Yes     | Supporting documentation  |
| ✅ Scripts/          | Yes     | Executable helpers        |
| ✅ Assets/           | Yes     | Templates, configs        |
| ✅ Commands (.md)    | Yes     | Command definitions       |
| ❌ .DS_Store         | No      | macOS metadata (excluded) |
| ❌ Temp files        | No      | Not tracked in source     |

## Integration with Git-Sync

**Git-sync already includes this:**

The `@git-sync` skill automatically runs this sync as a pre-sync step before pushing any folder. So this skill is useful when you want to:

- **Manually sync** without pushing to GitHub
- **Preview changes** before committing
- **Sync-only** without full git workflow
- **Debug sync issues** in isolation

**Relationship:**

```
Manual: @sync-helpful-agents-cursor → Review → @git-sync
Auto:   @git-sync → (runs this sync automatically) → Push
```

## Troubleshooting

### Sync Shows Many Deletions

**Symptom:** `rsync` reports many `D` (deleted) files

**Cause:** Files exist in `Helpful Agents/.cursor/` but not in workspace `.cursor/`

**Solutions:**

1. Check if files were intentionally deleted from workspace
2. If accidental deletion: Restore files from git history
3. If intentional cleanup: Proceed with sync (mirrors cleanup)

### Sync Fails: Permission Denied

**Symptom:** `rsync: permission denied`

**Solutions:**

1. Check file permissions: `ls -la .cursor/skills/`
2. Verify write access to Helpful Agents: `touch "Helpful Agents/test" && rm "Helpful Agents/test"`
3. Run with appropriate permissions

### No Changes Detected After Edit

**Symptom:** Made changes to skills but sync shows no changes

**Solutions:**

1. Verify you edited files in workspace `.cursor/` (not `Helpful Agents/.cursor/`)
2. Check file was saved: `ls -lt .cursor/skills/your-skill/SKILL.md`
3. Re-run sync with verbose output to see what's being compared

### Helpful Agents Has Uncommitted Changes

**Symptom:** Sync works but `git status` shows unexpected changes

**Solutions:**

1. Review changes: `cd "Helpful Agents" && git diff`
2. If changes are from previous unsynced work: Commit them first
3. If changes are unexpected: Use `git checkout -- .cursor/` to reset
4. Re-run sync after resolving

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Manual Sync After Creating New Skill

**User:**

```
I just created a new skill. Sync it to Helpful Agents.
```

**Agent Actions:**

1. Run pre-flight checks
2. Sync skills directory
3. Sync commands directory (no changes)
4. Report new skill detected in git status
5. Suggest reviewing and pushing

### Example 2: Sync Before Publishing

**User:**

```
@sync-helpful-agents-cursor
```

**Agent Actions:**

1. Verify source and destination
2. Run rsync for skills (8 folders synced, 1 modified)
3. Run rsync for commands (0 files, no changes)
4. Report summary with git status
5. Suggest next steps

### Example 3: Cleanup Deleted Skills

**User:**

```
I deleted production-clone command. Mirror that to Helpful Agents.
```

**Agent Actions:**

1. Run sync with `--delete` flag
2. Remove production-clone.md from Helpful Agents/.cursor/commands/
3. Report deletion in git status
4. Confirm deletion was intentional
5. Suggest committing cleanup

## Technical Details

### Rsync Strategy

**Why rsync over cp:**

- **Incremental**: Only copies changed files (faster)
- **Mirror**: `--delete` ensures exact replica
- **Preserves**: Maintains timestamps, permissions, structure
- **Reliable**: Battle-tested tool for synchronization

**Alternative approaches considered:**

- `cp -r`: No incremental updates, no deletion of removed files
- `git submodule`: Too complex for simple mirroring
- Manual copy: Error-prone, no automation

### Directory Structure

**Source (Workspace):**

```
.cursor/
├── skills/
│   ├── skill-name/
│   │   ├── SKILL.md
│   │   ├── references/
│   │   └── scripts/
│   └── ...
└── commands/
    └── command.md
```

**Destination (Helpful Agents):**

```
Helpful Agents/
└── .cursor/
    ├── skills/
    │   ├── skill-name/
    │   │   ├── SKILL.md
    │   │   ├── references/
    │   │   └── scripts/
    │   └── ...
    └── commands/
        └── command.md
```

**Exact mirror**: Structure, filenames, subdirectories all identical

## Related Skills

- **@git-sync**: Includes this sync automatically before pushing
- **@context-advisor**: Helps decide when to create new skills/commands

## Key Principles

1. **One-way sync**: Workspace → Helpful Agents (never reverse)
2. **True mirror**: `--delete` ensures exact replication
3. **Pre-push step**: Always sync before pushing Helpful Agents to GitHub
4. **Review changes**: Always check git diff before committing
5. **Idempotent**: Safe to run multiple times (no side effects if already synced)
