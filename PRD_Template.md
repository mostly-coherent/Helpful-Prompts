# PRD Template

This is a Product Requirement Document (PRD) baseline template for Adobe Unified Platform (AUP) Commerce - Platform Services Product Managers.

This PRD approach fosters building a robust Commerce Platform with foundational capabilities being de-coupled and available ahead of client adoption. Client adoption can be linked to / done through either CMEIntake or CME initiatives with detail experiences/workflows. In this PRD, there will be assertions and validated assumptions made about client adoption & E2E UI/UX expectations. Note that UI/UX workflows would likely not be part of this PRD.

**Length**: Keep the core PRD concise (≈≤4 pages). If it exceeds that, narrow the scope, split into multiple PRDs, or further distill the content before adding more detail.  
**Structure**: Group related use cases, requirements, and success metrics into logical subcategories/themes (via a "Subcategory" column or similar) instead of long flat lists, but adapt table shapes when another structure is clearly clearer.
